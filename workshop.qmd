## General Remarks

This repository contains scripts and notebooks showcasing several tools and scripts centered around ZEN, CZI image files, deep-learning models and related python packages.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebooks locally it is recommended to create a fresh conda environment. Please feel free to use the provided [YML file](workshop/env_smartmic.yml) (at your own risk) to create such an environment:

    conda env create --file zen_python.yml

> Important: If one wants to test the labeling & training directly on [arivis Cloud] or create a module it is required to have an account.
> 
> To use [Colab] one needs to have a Google account.
>
> To test and run an [arivis Cloud] module locally one needs [Docker Desktop] or an equivalent runtime installed

## Train a Deep-Learning Model for Semantic Segmentation on arivis Cloud

The general idea is to learn how to label a dataset on [arivis Cloud].

Dataset Name: **Smart_Microscopy_Workshop_2025_Nucleus_Semantic**

![Annotated Dataset](./images/apeer_dataset_nuc.png)

- label some nuclei "precisely"
- label background areas and edges
- embrace the idea of partial labeling

![Partial Annotations](./images/APEER_annotation_auto_background.gif)

- start a training to get a trained model as a *.czann file

Remark: The the modelfile: **cyto2022_nuc.czann** can be found inside the repository.

For more detailed information please visit: [Docs - Partial Annotations](https://docs.apeer.com/machine-learning/annotation-guidelines)


### Use the model in your python code

Once the model is trained it can be downloaded directly to your hard disk and used to segment images in ZEN or arivis Pro or your own python code.
